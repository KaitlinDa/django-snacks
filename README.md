## About
This project is a simple Django web application featuring two pages: a home page and an about page. It follows Django's conventional project structure and demonstrates the fundamental principles of web development with Django, including the creation of views, URLs, and templates. TailwindCSS and Flowbite have been integrated for basic styling, aligning with best practices for a modern, responsive design.

## Features
- Two main pages: Home and About, each served by their dedicated views and templates.
- Utilization of Django's inheritance feature with a base (ancestor) template to ensure a consistent navigation experience.
- Integration of TailwindCSS and Flowbite for minimalistic and responsive design.

## User Acceptance Tests
The application includes tests for verifying the correct status codes for the home and about pages and ensuring the appropriate templates are used, including the ancestor template.
